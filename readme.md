# magic

it's magic the gathering but ai... heh the name actually kinda works out well

so yeah it's a sveltekit application i made for the one stunt of "ai created this deck". if you have any ways to improve the weird sorting system, send in a issue/pr.

## if you want to use it yourself (why?)

1. clone the repo, install deps
2. download the bulk scryfall cards into prebuild
3. run the prebuild scripts
4. set up `.env` with working Cohere key
5. run the server and run ngrok
6. on your phone: open the thing, and scan all your cards
7. now, go to `/sorter`, choose your two colors, and hit start
